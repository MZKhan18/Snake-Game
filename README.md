## Created a new desktop application "Snake Game". Have a look at it and if you liked it then I am making the source code available in the "Source Code" code folder so that you can give it a try ðŸ¤˜.

## How to Create :
### If you want to create this game then follow the below steps :
#### 1. Open Eclipse IDE and create a new Java Project (Give it any name you want).
#### 2. Then create a package named gameCode (case sensitive) in your src directory of java project.
#### 3. Then Create the following three java classes under your gameCode package (Name the classes correctly as mentioned).
#####    a. MainClass (This will have a Main method).
#####    b. Frame.
#####    c. Panel.
#### 4. Now copy the source code of each class from the "Source Code" folder and paste it to the respective classes in your eclipse java project.
#### 5. Don't forget to copy the files i.e. the sound effects and images from the "Resource" folder.
#### 6. Create a folder named "res" in your java project.
#### 7. Copy paste all the resource files (points1.wav, collision.wav, imageLogo.png) to "res" folder of your java project.
#### 8. Now your project is ready and you can run it ðŸ™‚.

## If you don't want to create the game but want to play then don't worry, sooner than later I will upload the .exe file of this app so that you can install it in your device and run it ðŸ˜‰.
